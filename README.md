### Topic Map
![](images/RoboticsScope.jpg)

#### Requirements
- Ability to program in Python okayishly
- Finish what you take on (don't just start without finishing, you will thank yourself later)
- Don't give up, the world is grateful for what you have to bring to us with your newfound robotics knowledge. Don't give up.

# Theory
## Semester 1 (The core foundations) (60 days):
- [Machine Learning (Stanford CS229)](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS229) ML is used a lot because machines can learn to perform tasks better than how we programmers can instruct them to
- [Computer Vision (Carnegie Mellon 16-385)](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~16385/) Most perception for robots revolves around computer vision, this is crash course to that
- [Manipulation Estimation and Control (Carnegie Mellon (MEC))](https://github.com/lukaeerens93/MEC) Robots need to need to move, know where they are, and control themselves to keep up the good "motion", this is foundational to what comes next

## Semester 2 (Robust to the real world) (60 days)
- [Robot Autonomy (Carnegie Mellon)](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qj16faks8y4t0jj/AAB5QESVdpy_qsts22J6LkBBa?dl=0) Delves into all core aspects of robot autonomy for strong foundations in grasping, planning, mapping, decision-making etc.
- [Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition (Stanford CS231n)](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html) Best course on modern day neural net based perception
- [Statistical Methods in Robotics (Carnegie Mellon)](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fz28miofk05obzm/AAA2IV0LDq4H5e5C-aczPLFza?dl=0) Best introductory course on making robust intelligent robots that have to deal with uncertainty

## Semester 3 (Capable of Great Things) (100 days)
- [Geometric Computer Vision (Carnegie Mellon)](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/dv84bg2jubs37qi/AAB6R6rQUCD4dnk-R2-Hq2kIa?dl=0) Deals with projections, homography, epipolar geometry, stereoscopic vision, 3D reconstruction, Calibration
- [Convex Optimization (Carnegie Mellon)](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/convexopt/) Used to optimize motion of robots like Spot and Atlas from Boston Dynamics to give them smooth, fluid, steady, efficient gaits
- [Deep Reinforcement Learning and Control (Carnegie Mellon)](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/10-703) The future. That doesn't quite work yet. But worth studying nonetheless
- [SLAM]()
