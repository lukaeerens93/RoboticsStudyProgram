# Robotics Study Program

#### Requirements
- Ability to program in Python okayishly
- Finish what you take on (don't just start without finishing, you will thank yourself later)
- Don't give up, the world is grateful for what you have to bring to us with your newfound robotics knowledge. Don't give up.

## Semester 1 (The core foundations) (40 days):
- [Machine Learning (Stanford CS229)](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS229) ML is used a lot because machines can learn to perform tasks better than how we programmers can instruct them to
- [Computer Vision (Carnegie Mellon 16-385)](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~16385/) Most perception for robots revolves around computer vision, this is crash course to that
- [Manipulation Estimation and Control (Carnegie Mellon (MEC))](https://github.com/lukaeerens93/MEC) Robots need to need to move, know where they are, and control themselves to keep up the good "motion", this is foundational to what comes next

## Semester 2 (Building ultra capable robots) (40 days)
- [Robot Autonomy (Carnegie Mellon)](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qj16faks8y4t0jj/AAB5QESVdpy_qsts22J6LkBBa?dl=0)
